### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 9, part 1

    This lab is one of my favorite labs to do because this specific lab is not only challenging, but it also requires a different way of using your problem solving skills. Within this lab, I learned how to create a spelling checker program that will scan a document file and list out any misspelled words. It also uses the dictionary file in order to check whether the word is misspelled or not.

* Lab 10, part 1

    This specific lab was listed as one of my favorite labs because it requires a lot of problem interpretation and it needs students to look over at the header file in order to check what function is available for them to use. Throughout the lab, I learned how to use 2D vectors to organize California’s population data by county with the given data files. It is really interesting how you can utilize and access 2 different files and use one of the files within your code to check whether or not this targeted file is correct or not.

* Lab 11, part 2

    This specific lab is my most favorite because it goes over the specific classes that you need to look out for while coding. There are 2 different classes, one public and one private. I have to utilize the different classes within the code in order to make the guessing game work in a more simpler and cleaner way for other coders to see and visualize. Within this lab, I learned how to correctly use different functions to minimize and simplify the amount of coding compared to a similar lab that I did prior to this lab.
